## goatplot

Plotting library for Gtk+ 3.x using cairo.

#### Status

It does work for some cases but still leaves many features to be desired, not to mention that a huge refactor is required.

### Build

To build the library and the demo just do
```bash
waf configure debug -j2
```

Note: The demo will launch, a screenshot is created, the demo closes, this is expected behaviour and the demo can be launched again manually.
